You will need to install the following plugins: mysql-connector-python, passlib, validate_email

PHPMyAdmin - https://ec2-52-4-116-111.compute-1.amazonaws.com/phpmyadmin (must be on campus, use VPN, or give me your home IP)

I have the certs and will email them out.  I don't want to put them on the repo.
